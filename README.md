### This plugin is in development and NOT ready for use!
# Filter (by AxionSpire)
The ultimate text filtering and logging plugin. Heavily customizable.

[Download](https://github.com/AxionSpire/Filter/releases)
## Features
### Filters
- Chat messages
- Item names (anvils)
- Player names
- Chosen commands (filters arguments, only for commands in the config)
- More coming soon!
### Administration
- Simple, convenient GUI (`/filter menu`)
- Player history and logs (`/filter logs (player)`)
- Filter sets easily manageable (both in-game (`/filter sets`) and in `config.yml`)
### Technical
- Database log synchronization (Set up in `config.yml`, uses MySQL to sync player logs to all servers in a network)
- [Planned for future] Simple developer API (Allows other plugins to use this plugin's pre-written filters)
