## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report vulnerabilities via email to [security@axionspire.net](mailto:security@axionspire.net) or through GitHub's dedicated method (**NOT using Issues**). Include as detailed of a report as possible.
We will reward researchers in a way outlined in our [OSS Contributor Rewards](https://wiki.axionspire.net/en/Rewards/oss) program, possibly extending to money (though likely it will be in-game rewards, as this is a hobby project).
